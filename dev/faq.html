                Centrally located near many of the country’s most fascinating tourist destinations, San Juan del Sur is two and a half hours south of Managua, an hour and a half south of the historic colonial town of Granada, thirty minutes north of the Costa Rican border, and less than twenty minutes from the shores of Lake Nicaragua.
                <br><br>
                Downtown San Juan Del Sur is the definition of colorful. Painted shops and murals dot the streets. Beach-side restaurants and bars beckon. Characters sit on stoops and sip coffee in cafes. You may even see a parrot dancing on wrought-iron gate or a howler monkey out for a stroll.
                <br><br>
                Waves crest and lift seasoned veterans and novices alike from May through early December – when the most south swells hit Nicaragua’s Pacific coast. The most popular and easily accessible surfing beach close to town is Playa Maderas – just a 20-minute excursion from Pelican Eyes Resort & Spa.

            <p class="texto">
                <strong>Rental Cars & Inter-Country Bus Transportation: </strong>Rental cars are available, however, Pelican Eyes suggests that driving in Nicaragua cab be challenging, and is best left to experienced Nicaragua travelers and professionals.
In most cases, rental cars are not allowed to cross the border. To travel from Liberia, Costa Rica to San Juan del Sur, you may wish to take a taxi to the border and arrange with our concierge to be met at the border for the balance of the trip to Pelican Eyes. The border crossing itself is very busy and there can be substantial delays. <br><br>

<strong>Immigration & Customs:</strong> Visitors from North America and most European countries are not required to have a visa to enter Nicaragua, but you will need a passport with at least six months remaining duration, and pay an entry fee of ten ($10) US dollars.

                <strong>By Car:</strong> From Managua, drive south on CA-1 to the town of Rivas and follow the signs westward to reach San Juan del Sur (approximately 28km/17 miles). Please use the following landmarks and directions to get to our hotel. Upon entering the town and just beyond the Texaco Station, continue on the main road into downtown San Juan del Sur; follow the street down to the beach about 3 blocks. Turn left where the street comes to a “T”, Restaurante El Timón restaurant will be in front. Drive two blocks and turn left (the BDF bank will be on your left). Continue straight until you reach our hotel about four blocks (past the park and church). Drive straight up the cobblestone driveway. Park in the car park at the top of the driveway and our welcoming staff will take it from there! <br><br>
                <strong>By Bus:</strong> Express buses leave the parada del bus [bus stop] at Managua’s Mercado Roberto Huembes [Central Market] several times each day for the two-and-a-half-hour journey to San Juan del Sur, beginning at 6 a.m. From the bus station in San Juan, it is just a two-block walk to Pelican Eyes, or, if you’d prefer, a local taxi will gladly transport you and your luggage to the hotel.

            <h5>History & Our Name</h5>
            <p class="texto">
                In San Juan bay, pelicans dive and fish, and occasionally, ensnare themselves in fishing lure. One day the founder of Pelican Eyes Resort and Hotel helped untangle a pelican from a line and found himself looking into the bird’s beautiful eyes. He felt a deep admiration for the plucky bird and renamed his sailboat “Pelican Eyes.” Pelican Eyes Resort and Hotel was first a sailing charter business, and eventually grew into the incredible resort we know today.

            <h5>About Nicaragua</h5>
            <div class="texto">
                By 2006, tourism in Nicaragua had become the second largest industry in the nation, over the last 7 years tourism has grown about 70% nationwide with rates of 10%–16% annually. Nicaragua had seen positive growth in the tourism sector over the last decade, and it became the largest industry in 2007. The increase and growth led to the income from tourism to rise more than 300% over a period of 10 years. The growth in tourism has also positively affected the agricultural, commercial, and finance industries, as well as the construction industry.
                <br><br>
Every year about 60,000 U.S. citizens visit Nicaragua, primarily business people, tourists, and those visiting relatives. Some 5,300 people from the U.S. reside in the country now. The majority of tourists who visit Nicaragua are from the U.S., Central or South America, and Europe. According to the Ministry of Tourism of Nicaragua (INTUR), the colonial cities of León and Granada are the preferred spots for tourists. Also, the cities of Masaya, Rivas and the likes of San Juan del Sur, El Ostional, San Juan River, Ometepe, Mombacho Volcano, the Corn Islands, and others are main tourist attractions. In addition, ecotourism and surfing attract many tourists to Nicaragua.
